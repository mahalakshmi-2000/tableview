Celebrating the Lord Ganesha festival-Anant Chaturdashi read more..Inspiration from LordGaneshThis God of knowledge and the remover of obstacles is also the older son of Lord Shiva. Lord Ganesha is also called Vinayak ( knowledgeable ) or Vighneshwer (god to remove obstacles). He is worshipped, or at least remembered, in the beginning of any auspicious performance for blessings and auspiciousness.He has four hands, elephant\s head and a big belly. His vehicle is a tiny mouse. In his hands he carries a rope (to carry devotees to the truth), an axe (to cut devotees\ attachments), and a sweet dessert ball -laddoo- (to reward devotees for spiritual activity). His fourth hand\s palm is always extended to bless people.A unique combination of his elephant-like head and a quick moving tiny mouse vehicle represents tremendous wisdom, intellegence, and presence of mind.Lord Ganeshjee\s big head inspires us to think big and think profitably; the big ears prompts us to listen patiently to new ideas and suggestions; the narrow eyes points to deep concentration needed to finish tasks in hand well and quickly; the long nose tells us to poke around inquisitively to learn more; and small mouth reminds us to speak less and listen more </p>","{""job_id"": """", ""job_title"": ""Resellers"", ""job_known_as"": ""['Reseller','Channel Partner']"", ""job_function"": ""Sales"", ""job_area"": ""Sales & Account Management"", ""company"": ""Antech Micro System Pvt.Ltd"", ""industry"": ""Information Technology"", ""experience_years_min"": 1.0, ""experience_years_max"": 3.0, ""job_level"": ""basic"", ""job_type"": ""full-time"", ""location"": ""Kolkata, Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Chennai, Bengaluru"", ""technologies"": """", ""posted_date"": """", ""url"": ""https://www.naukri.com/job-listings-resellers-antech-micro-system-pvt-ltd-kolkata-mumbai-new-delhi-hyderabad-pune-chennai-bengaluru-1-to-3-years-030724500446?src=cluster&sid=17265691055646111_11&xp=3&px=2"", ""status"": ""Success"", ""error"": """", ""input_tokens"": 688, ""output_tokens"": 217}"
